Hello.

This is a simple Inventory Management System.


Steps To Run The Program

Step 1: Install XAMPP
Step 2: Go to C: drive and open xampp-> htdocs
Step 3: Paste the inv_project in htdocs folder
Step 4: Open MyPhPAdmin Dashboard - http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ and Create a database and give a name as you wish (if the name doesn't work give "project_inv")
Step 5: Import the file named "project_inv.php" to the database
Step 6: Now run the main program called "index.php" in the localhost (eg. http://localhost/inv_project/public_html/index.php)

Thanks For Later.
